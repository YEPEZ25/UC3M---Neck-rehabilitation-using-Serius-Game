UC3M -  Integrating vision-based head movement detection into a serious game towards game-based neck pain treatment

Serious games are a type of virtual game whose objective goes beyond entertainment, an application is the rehabilitation of the user, increasing their motivation and therefore improving the effectiveness of therapies. The aim of this project is to develop a serious game for patients with different degrees of cervicalgia, cervical osteoarthritis, or any condition that affects the mobility of the cervicals. To do this, the classic Pac-Man video game has been used together with a vision system capable of detecting the face and its orientation. By combining these modules, Pac-Man's movement on the map is controlled according to the orientation of the patient's face. A major advantage of this type of therapy compared to conventional therapies is the ability to objectively assess the patient. The video game can record multiple quantitative variables that indicate the patient's progress. However, a disadvantage could be the fatigue or frustration that may arise if the patient fails to play the game adequately. This drawback can be solved by adapting the level of the game to the patient's capabilities.
